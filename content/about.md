title: About us
---

The team is made up of young people with heterogeneous skills, enabling us to address the main aspects of the software lifecycle.

We are a company open to new ideas and based on mutual trust and we work together toward a common vision.

Our head office is located in Italy, but it is possible to work with us remotely from anywhere in the world: currently the group is made of experts from three different countries.

We are a fast-growing group and are always looking for new talent to come on board.
