    platform: 
      title: Private Cloud Platform
      content: The in-house cloud solution offered provides a complete package for managing customer tenants, applications, hardware, and configurations. It operates on a service-based model, ensuring each component functions independently and communicates securely through APIs. A centralized authentication system governs access control. Notable features include real-time monitoring, configuration adjustments, application customization, and comprehensive identity management control.
    indoornav:
      title: Indoor Navigation Solution
      content: The indoor navigation solution presents a comprehensive system for real-time internal navigation, encompassing internal flow routing and dynamic exit path calculation. Its core function is to furnish vital life-saving information during emergencies within confined spaces. Furthermore, the solution facilitates the storage and post-visualization of registered pathways, oversees customer tenants and environment management, and supports active monitoring requests for designated environments.
    evcharging:
      title: Electric Vehicle Charging Platform
      content: The suite of electric vehicle (EV) charging software solutions encompasses middleware and backend functionalities tailored for comprehensive system operation. These features encompass payment systems, billing processes, user management, content management system (CMS) interactions, user authentication protocols, end-user notification management, electric vehicle recharge lifecycle oversight, back-office management portal facilitation, and provision of end-user applications and web applications.
    deplantmon:
      title: Distributed Energy Plant Monitor and Management System
      content: The data analysis and visualization tool designed for energy plants prioritizes real-time retrieval of sensor data, calculation of key performance indicators (KPIs) based on energy dynamics and metrics, and the creation of fully customizable dashboards and widgets for precise visualizations.
    firmware:
      title: Firmware Development​
      content: The development entails embedded firmware creation for ESP-32 and STM32 platforms, integrating various sensors such as temperature, pressure, humidity, light detection, and audio detection. Connectivity is established through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) and Standard WiFi (2.4GHz/5GHz), while communication protocols employed include HTTPS, MQTT, and CoAP.
