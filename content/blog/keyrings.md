This is the third part of the series on securing applications on Linux. The first part was about Linux Seccompand the second part was about Linux Landlock. This third part is about Linux Keyrings.

## What are Linux Keyrings?

As usual we start citing the appropriate man page, [keyrings(7)](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/keyrings.7.html):

```
The Linux key-management facility is primarily a way for various
kernel components to retain or cache security data,
authentication keys, encryption keys, and other data in the
kernel
System call interfaces are provided so that user-space programs
can manage those objects and also use the facility for their own
purposes; see add_key(2), request_key(2), and keyctl(2).
```

So, this means that we can use the kernel as a vault, storing secrets in it. There are various types of keys we can create:

* keyrings – are special keys to which other keys or keyrings can be linked to, they work almost as a directory, their purpose is to keep alive keys so that those keys are not garbage collected by the kernel

* user – are keys which maximum size is 32,767 bytes, they are used to store user specific data and are managed by user
space applications

* logon – similar to user keys except that cannot be read from user space, those are useful to store credentials such as user and password

* big_key – similar to user except that they can be up to 1MiB in size, these kind of keys could may be stored on tmpfs

We mentioned before that if a key is not anchored to a keyring it will be garbage collected by the kernel, so the kernel offers a way to keep keys alive, this is done by linking keys to a keyring. Notice that keyrings themselves can be garbage collected, so in turn also keyrings need to be anchored to another keyring. To solve this problem the kernel makes available some keyrings which sole purpose is to be used as anchors, these keyrings are:

* Process keyrings – we’ll look at them in a moment, since are the ones we’ll use in this article
  * process-keyring(7)
  * thread-keyring(7)
  * session-keyring(7)

* User keyrings – these are per UID keyrings and are shared with all the processes spawned by the same UID
  * user-keyring(7)
  * user-session-keyring(7)

* Persistence keyrings – these are keyrings which can persist across user sessions, so that programs that need to use    credentials to perform operations can get them without the need of a user session
  * persistent-keyring(7)

* Special keyrings – thes are keyrings that holds system wide keys, such as the ones used for the kernel modules signature verification

Notice that the one above is a short description and the reader is encouraged to check appropriate man pages to have a deeper understanding of the topic.

## Process Keyrings

These keyrings exist as anchoring keyring in order to be used by processes and threads. Their existence is directly bound to the process existence, so as long as the process is alive it will be possible to access the keyring. There are three types of process keyrings:

* process-keyring(7) – it is created when a process accesses it for the first time, and it is accessible by all the threads of the process, notice however that on execve(2) the keyring it is destroyed, and this makes perfectly sense as this syscall replaces entirely the process memory image

* thread-keyring(7) – it is created when a thread accesses it for the first time, and it is accessible only by the thread that created it and gets destroyed when the thread terminates

* session-keyring(7) – it is a process keyring that survives across clone(2), fork(2) and execve(2) syscalls, sessions can be joined by processes or new sessions can be created, usually a session keyring is created when user logs in and destroyed when user logs out

## Key permissions

Since keys are sensitive information, those must be protected by permissions. Permissions are security attributes attached to keys. Keys as files are owned by a user ID and group ID. Then on top of that there is a bitmask of permissions which detemines what can be done with the key by user ID, group ID and others. The permissions are:

* read – the key can be read
* write – the key can be written
* search – the key can be searched
* link – the key can be linked to a keyring
* setattr – the key attributes like owner, group, permission mask and timeout to be changed
* view – allows to view type description and other parameters

There’s also another access right called possessor which specifies rights granted if a key is determined to be possessed by the caller. keyctl(1) has a nice table which describes the access rights:

```bash
Possessor UID       GID       Other     Permission Granted
========  ========  ========  ========  ==================
01000000  00010000  00000100  00000001  View
02000000  00020000  00000200  00000002  Read
04000000  00040000  00000400  00000004  Write
08000000  00080000  00000800  00000008  Search
10000000  00100000  00001000  00000010  Link
20000000  00200000  00002000  00000020  Set Attribute
3f000000  003f0000  00003f00  0000003f  All
```

So suppose we want to give all privileges to UID and Possessor, and view + read to the others we would do set its permissions to 0x3f3f0303.

The kernel exposes key information through the /proc/keys file and other multiple files described into keyrings(7) manpage. Let’s take a look at it

```bash
$ cat /proc/keys
05451ea7 I--Q---     4 perm 1f3f0000  1000 65534 keyring   _uid.1000: empty
14f7afae I--Q---     1 perm 1f3f0000  1000 65534 keyring   _uid_ses.1000: 1
293d8fc8 I--Q---    15 perm 3f030000  1000  1000 keyring   _ses: 1
3b3232a6 I--Q---   376 perm 3f030000  1000  1000 keyring   _ses: 1
```

The first column is the key ID, keys are represented as 32bit integers, in this view are formatted in hexadecimal. The second column shows flags, in this case all the keys are instantiated (I) and contribute to the user quota (Q). The third column tells how many struct cred are pinning that specific key, which approximately is the number of living threads and open files. The fourth column tells when the key will expire (all the keys here are marked as perm which means permanent). The fifth column is the permissions bitmask. The sixth column is the UID of the key owner. The seventh column is the GID of the key owner. The eighth column is the key type. The ninth column is the description of the key.

## How to use Linux Keyrings?

Linux provides a tool named keyctl which can be used to create/delete/update keys and keyrings. Let’s see how to use it.

```bash
# create a new keyring attached to the default session (@s) one, and name it my_keyring
# notice that @s is created on user login and destroyed on logout, the command returns
# the key ID of the newly created keyring
$  keyctl newring my_keyring @s
740991106

# show the default session keyring, notice that the keyring we created is attached to it
# along with the user keyring
$  keyctl show @s
Keyring
 993145510 --alswrv   1000  1000  keyring: _ses
  88415911 --alswrv   1000 65534   \_ keyring: _uid.1000
 740991106 --alswrv   1000  1000   \_ keyring: my_keyring

# add a new key (we generate it randomly with openssl) to the keyring we created,
# as for the keyring command, this command returns the key ID of the newly created key
$  keyctl add user my_key (openssl rand 32) 740991106
1032028779

# show the keyring again, notice that the key we created is attached to it
$  keyctl show @s
Keyring
 993145510 --alswrv   1000  1000  keyring: _ses
  88415911 --alswrv   1000 65534   \_ keyring: _uid.1000
 740991106 --alswrv   1000  1000   \_ keyring: my_keyring
1032028779 --alswrv   1000  1000       \_ user: my_key

# show the key we created
$ keyctl read 1032028779
32 bytes of data in key:
e2362872 8b32fc4f bb6eca6d 4f90be31 4b84a6ed cfd4535a c4d66991 0d2eb2bc

# we can also pipe data in raw format to other applications
$ keyctl pipe 1032028779 | hexyl

Before we move on with Go code, we’re going to show another example to compute Diffie-Hellman directly using keyrings feature.

This is our private key in hex

```bash
0f6f7590dcee920ca7a1f9dc8ff94e
87e4484b223d1fd57d3ee00a2f4616

```

This is our prime module

```bash
fe4e0bd59f860a8eda80ad8663ad1d
3b55e19670a1a43d9e203428ca2794
ba934cb8d6ba2233faf96ef6c6a14a

564c14cf5567b8b32eb1caa0579df2
301f
```

And this is our generator

```bash
02
```

So lets say we want to generate our public key doing `(generator ^ private_key) mod prime_module`, we can do it with the following code. Notice that in this example before loading our parameters and key we need to generate those. This can be achievied with openssl as follows:

```bash
openssl dhparam -check -out dh.pem 2048
openssl genpkey -paramfile dh.pem -text
```

Then you’ve to adjust a bit the format like removing the ‘:’ between hex bytes and then exporting the values e.g., as environment variables (do not forget to unset once loaded in the keyring, otherwise we’re voiding the purpose of using keyrings). Moreover consider this is just an example using the keyctl commandline tool, we could achieve the same result using APIs.

Once we’ve our params as env variable we can proceed with the following commands:

```bash
# we first load the prime module, the private key and the generator in the keyring
keyctl add user prime $prime @s
261425615

keyctl add user priv_key $priv_key @s
195168655

keyctl add user generator $generator @s
688070769

# lets show the keyring
keyctl show @s
Keyring
 611679097 --alswrv   1000  1000  keyring: _ses
 504006137 --alswrv   1000 65534   \_ keyring: _uid.1000
 688070769 --alswrv   1000  1000   \_ user: generator
 195168655 --alswrv   1000  1000   \_ user: priv_key
 261425615 --alswrv   1000  1000   \_ user: prime

# we then compute the public key doing 'keyctl dh_compute <private> <prime> <base>'
keyctl dh_compute 195168655 261425615 688070769
520 bytes of data in result:

## Using Keyrings in Go

In the following Go example code, we illustrate how we can use keyring facilities to store an ED25519 private key. The key is then used to sign and verify (with its public counterpart) a payload. We’re going to use the golang/x/unix package to interact with the kernel keyring, as it provides syscalls wrappers, and the crypto/ed25519 package to create/parse keys, sign and verify the payload.

The Go code, creates an HTTP service which exposes two endpoints:

* /generate → forges a simple JSON payload with some data and its ED25519 base64 encoded signature e.g,:

```json
{
  "payload":"some_data_1693390750",
  "signature":"QO1mZet+wpgODp+fs8PbfHvKqYBrX2OGxfxDyT8e+tH7DBVyBUafFNCTCbEiFrhm0urgrON9GkQBdv/0REpIBw=="
}
```

* /verify → accepts the above payload computes the payload field signature and compares it with the one in the signature field

When the service bootstraps it generates a new ED25519 key and stores it in the process keyring, then it sets the permissions on the keyring and on the key so that it can be accessed by other threads in the process. The the endpoints described above make use of some utilities functions to retrieve and use the key to perform sign and verify.

```go
package main

import (
	"crypto"
	"crypto/ed25519"
	"encoding/base64"
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"
	"log"

    // this is the description of the key we're going to store in the keyring
	keyName = "priv_ed25519_key"
)

var (
    // this is our process keyring ID
    // it initialized in main()
	ringId = 0

			slog.Error("failed to decode signature", "error", err)
			w.WriteHeader(http.StatusBadRequest)
			return
		}

        // verify the signature with the public key stored in the keyring
		res, err := verifyPayload([]byte(payload.Payload), sig, ringId)
		if err != nil {
			slog.Error("failed to execute payload verification", "error", err)
			w.WriteHeader(http.StatusInternalServerError)
			return
		}

        // if the signature is not valid, return 401
		if !res {
			slog.Error("failed to verify payload", "error", res)
			w.WriteHeader(http.StatusUnauthorized)
			return
		}

		slog.Info("payload verified", "payload", payload.Payload)
	})

	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", nil)
}
```

Now we can test our service with curl:

```bash
# we ask our service to generate a new payload along with its signature
curl  -v '<http://localhost:8080/generate'> | jq

## Conclusion

In this article we’ve seen how to use Linux Keyrings to store sensitive information such as keys. We’ve seen how to use the keyctl commandline tool to create/delete/update keys and keyrings. Then we’ve seen how to use the golang/x/unix package to interact with the kernel keyring, as it provides syscalls wrappers, and the crypto/ed25519 package to create/parse keys, sign and verify the payload. It is a lot of material to digest, but it is worth to improve security of our applications, and moreover it is fun to learn new things! Please consider that we scratched the surface of a huge topic, so the motivated person is encouraged to go through man pages and dive deeper into the topic.
